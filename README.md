### Brilliant Continuous Deployment

Overview
========

`Strider` is an Open Source Continuous Deployment / Continuous Integration
platform. It is written in Node.JS / JavaScript and uses MongoDB as a backing
store. It is published under the BSD license.

Strider is extremely customizable through plugins. Plugins can 

- add hooks to perform arbitrary actions during build.
- modify the database schema to add custom fields.
- register their own HTTP routes.
- subscribe to and emit socket events.
- create or modify user interfaces within Strider.
- so much more! just use your imagination!

For more details check out the [introductory chapter of the Strider Book][book-intro]

## General Requirements

- nodejs, v0.8 or v0.10
- mongodb (local or remote)
- git >= 1.7.10


## Running on Infrastructure

Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your system. You can get the latest version at [mongodb.org][mongo-download].

Next you will need Node.JS. You can get binary packages for most platforms at [nodejs.org][nodejs].

Once you have Node.JS on your system, you can fetch & install all the dependencies for your Strider clone
by executing the following command in the project root:

```no-highlight
npm install
```

### Configuring

`Strider` configuration comes from environment variables. Most of the default
values should work fine for running on localhost, however for an
Internet-accessible deployment the following variables will need to be exported:

  - `PORT` : Port that strider runs on, optional (defaults to 3000).
  - `DB_URI` : MongoDB DB URI if not localhost (you can safely use MongoLab free plan - works great)
  - `SERVER_NAME` : Address at which server will be accessible on the Internet. E.g. `https://strider.example.com` (note: no trailing slash)
  - `PLUGIN_GITHUB_APP_ID`, `PLUGIN_GITHUB_APP_SECRET`: Github app ID & secret (assuming not running on localhost:3000) - you can register a new one
  at https://github.com/settings/applications/new - the Main URL should be the same as server name above,
  and the callback URL should be server name with the path /auth/github/callback.
  E.g. https://strider.example.com/auth/github/callback
  - `PLUGIN_BITBUCKET_APP_KEY`, `PLUGIN_BITBUCKET_APP_SECRET`, `PLUGIN_BITBBUCKET_HOSTNAME`: BitBucket app key, secret & server hostname. Needed if you're using BitBucket provider. More info at https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider-bitbucket.

  - If you want email notifications, configure an SMTP server (we recommend Mailgun for SMTP if you need a server - free account gives 200 emails / day):
    - `SMTP_HOST`: SMTP server hostname e.g. smtp.example.com
    - `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP server port e.g. 587 (default)
    - `SMTP_USER`: SMTP auth username e.g. "myuser"
    - `SMTP_PASS`: SMTP auth password e.g. "supersecret"
    - `SMTP_FROM`: Default FROM address e.g. "Strider <noreply@stridercd.com>" (default)


### Adding Initial Admin User

`Strider` isn't much use without an account to login with. Once you create an administrative user, you can invite as many
other people as you like to your instance. There is a simple CLI subcommand to help you create the initial user:

```no-highlight
node bin/strider addUser
```

Example run:

```no-highlight
$ node bin/strider addUser
Enter email []: strider@example.com
Is admin? (y/n) [n]: y
Enter password []: *******

Email:    strider@example.com
Password: ****
isAdmin:  true
OK? (y/n) [y]:
22 Oct 21:21:01 - info: Connecting to MongoDB URL: mongodb://localhost/strider-foss
22 Oct 21:21:01 - info: User added successfully! Enjoy.
```

See the [strider-cli] for more details.

### Starting Strider

Once `Strider` has been installed and configured, it can be started with:

```no-highlight
npm start
```

### Managing Plugins

Strider plugins are simply node modules, however managing them with npm can prove problematic. To combat this, the `strider` binary helps you manage plugins. You can use it to:

- list local plugins
- list remote plugins
- install plugins
- remove plugins
- create new plugins

#### Listing Available Plugins

To list all plugins run `bin/strider list --all`

The data is fetched from the official Strider [ecosystem index](https://github.com/Strider-CD/ecosystem-index) with version numbers cross-referenced against your locally installed plugins.

#### Installing Plugins

If you found a plugin that you'd like to install, let's say it's called `strider-sweet-plugin` you can do so easily

Just run `bin/strider install strider-sweet-plugin`

First we check to see if you've got it installed already. If not, we look it up in the [ecosystem index](https://github.com/Strider-CD/ecosystem-index) to find out which github repository and tag to clone. Finally we npm install and restart strider if it's running.

Please note that the restart technique will only work if you're using `bin/strider` to run strider. Otherwise you'll need to manually restart strider.

#### Creating New Plugins

To get started, run `bin/strider init`

```no-highlight
plugin: name:  strider-sweet-plugin
plugin: description:  Candy and stuff!
plugin: author:
Cloning into '/Users/keyvan/Projects/Strider-CD/strider/node_modules/strider-sweet-plugin'...
remote: Counting objects: 20, done.
remote: Total 20 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (20/20), done.
Checking connectivity... done.

A strider plugin template has been prepared for you in the following directory
        /Users/keyvan/Projects/Strider-CD/strider/node_modules/strider-sweet-plugin
Please view the README and begin editing the package.json.
Make sure to change the git remote to wherever you're hosting your plugin source code
When you're ready to publish, submit a pull request to https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider-plugins
If you have any questions or need help, you can find us in irc.freenode.net #strider
```

For more information on the internals check out the new plugin that was generated. Many features of Strider plugins are shown and well-commented. For more details about extending Strider check out [existing plugins](https://github.com/Strider-CD?query=strider-) or [strider-extension-loader][extending]

### Strider on Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

To get up and running quickly on Heroku, you can simply use the button above.
If you run into any issues, you can deploy manually with the steps below.

```no-highlight
heroku create
heroku addons:add mongolab
git push heroku master
heroku open
```

If you want support for languages other than Node.js and Python, you'll need to
set the buildpack for your app. Currently this enables support for Ruby 2.0.0.

```no-highlight
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git
```


## Docker Quickstart

`docker pull niallo/strider`

For a fully self-contained and pre-built strider installation, check out
the [Strider Trusted Build][pre-built].

There's a walkthrough of setting it up [on our blog][blog-walkthrough].

### Modular Docker Image

Please see [docker-strider](https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/docker-strider)


## Require()'ing Strider

Strider can be `require()`-ed like any other NPM module. This is particularly useful when you want to

- Make Strider a dependency at a specific version
- Choose exactly which plugins to install
- Customize configuration
- Do other crazy stuff

For example, you could have a project with its own `package.json` that depends
on `strider` at a specific version, along with any other extensions you choose
loaded from a particular filesystem location. Then you could write a simple
initialization shim like the following:

```JavaScript
var strider = require('strider')

var instance = strider("/path/to/extensions/dir", config, function(err, initialized, appInstance) {
    console.log("Strider is now running")
})
```
