<hr/><strong>Remove Github Webhooks</strong>
<p>
  If you ONLY want to kickoff tests manually via the
  Strider web interface, Strider can remove the webhook
  from Github. This will mean Strider is never notified
  of any commits you make. If you change your mind
  later, we can always add them back for you from this
  page.
