Released Nov 16th 2013

Major refactor, almost everything has changed:

- Pluggable VCS providers enable:
  + Git
  + Github Enterprise
  + BitBucket
  + Generic Git
  + 3rd party projects working on Gitlab

- Per-branch repos and config. E.g. "release" branch can have different config from "master" branch.
- Testing of Pull Requests.
- Per-projet plugin configuration. Plugins can be ordered and configured entirely through the web UI.

## 1.3 [milestone](https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider/issues?milestone=2)
- This seems like ages ago...
- Records are blurry back here - look at the git log for information.
